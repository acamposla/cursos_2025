#  Basic Math and Calculus Review

We will kick off the first chapter covering:
- What numbers are and how variables and functions work on a Cartesian system
- Exponents and logarithms
- Learn the two basic operations of calculus: derivatives and integrals.

## Number Theory

*Natural numbers* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
*Whole numbres* Adding to natural numbers, the concept of “0” 
*Integers* Whole positive and negative numners
*Rational numbers* Any number that you can express as a fraction, such as 2/3
*Irrational numbers* This includes the famous PI, square roots of certain numbers like Euler’s number 
*Real numbers* include rational as well as irrational numbers
*Complex and imaginary numbers*  type when you take the square root of a negative number


## Order of Operations
